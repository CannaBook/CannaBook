Once you have mixed the mustard thoroughly into the sauce, switch to using a rubber spatula and mix in the cooked pasta, cannabis-infused oil and pasta water, mixing to coat.\n\n(note) - It is fine if you still have some unmelted vegan cheese shreds. This is due to some vegan cheeses not melting quickly.\n\n3. Salt and pepper to taste. If your pasta is too runny, add more nutritional yeast.\n\n4. If you want to dose the whole batch with THC, you can add in the cannabis oil at this point and mix it thoroughly. Or you can let your guests add a drizzle on top of their plates individually.\n\n5. Cover the pot and remove from heat. Put it aside.\n\n6. Heat olive oil in an oven-safe skillet on medium-high. Once hot, toss in the  jackfruit. Cook until any excess moisture is cooked out and the edges get crispy. Add salt and pepper to taste, then remove from heat.\n\n7. Mix together the jackfruit and the barbecue sauce. Place the skillet under the broiler, handle out, on high. Keep a close eye on your pan and make sure nothing burns.\n\n8.
